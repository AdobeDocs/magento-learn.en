# Grid on the storefront {#main-page-heading}

We are all used to seeing [!UICONTROL UiComponents] grids on the Magento backend, such as the product page grid. We can create the same grid on the Magento 2 storefront. These videos show you how to create [!UICONTROL UiComponents] grids on the storefront in your Magento 2 store.

We will see a lot of PHP and xml, but the grids are built on JavaScript. JavaScript renders parts of the UI interface on the browser side, regardless of the page context.

As a result, we get a [!UICONTROL UiComponents] grid on the storefront with columns for product name, quantity and price. The price column will be displayed with price formatting.

* Create a module with install scripts (**FreeJsVideos_FrontendGridUi**)
* Routes and controllers
* **di.xml, model, resource model, dataProvider, layout and grid listing**

In the second video, we will modify our [!UICONTROL UiComponent] with a little customization and change the appearance of the price column and customization using mixins.
* Price rendering
* Mixins
