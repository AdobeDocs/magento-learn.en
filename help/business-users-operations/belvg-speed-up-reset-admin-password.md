**NOTE:** Regarding changing the password with PHP: it is generally not a best practice to edit anything in the database directly, specifically sensitive password information. That method may not function in all cases. It is a best practice to reset passwords with CLI commands, as described in Magento [DevDocs](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/install-gde/install/cli/install-cli-subcommands-admin.html)
