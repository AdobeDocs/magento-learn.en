# Grid on the Storefront

We are all used to seeing UiComponents grids on the Magento backend office, such as the product page grid. We can create same grid on the Magento 2 storefront. These videos show you how to create UiComponents Grids on the storefront in your Magento 2 store.

We will see a lot of php and xml, but the grids are built on JavaScript. JavaScript renders parts of UI Interface on the browser side regardless of the page context.

As the result, we get a UiComponents grid on the storefront with columns for Product Name, Quantity and Price. The Price column will be displayed with the price formatting.
