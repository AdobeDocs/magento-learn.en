# Debug the theme for exception Required parameter theme_dir was not passed

In this video, we’ll see how to debug why theme could not working when you faced with exception “Required parameter 'theme_dir' was not passed”. 

Running a little ahead I will say that error message means that you have a theme configured which doesn't exist on the Magento file-system, but first things first, try to imagine the situation when you really don’t know from what place that’s error message come from. You just see this message on the screen and site owner hanging over you a told we need to fix that ASAP!
