# Developing patches in Declarative Schema v2.3

In this short video, we will demonstrate how to create product attribute with data patch. So, first we need to create class AddSimpleAttribute and implement DataPatchInterface, right after that we need to instantiate EavSetupFactory class within the constructor.

#### Who is this video for?
* Developers

**Declarative Schema was designed to simplify the Magento installation and upgrade processes. Previously, developers had to write database scripts in PHP for each new version of Magento. Various scripts were required for:**
* Installing and upgrading the database schema
* Installing and upgrading data
* Invoking other operations that are required each time Magento was installed or upgraded
